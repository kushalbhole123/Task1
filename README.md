# Task1
A **bar chart** visualizes categorical data (e.g., gender distribution), where each bar represents a category's frequency. A **histogram** visualizes continuous data (e.g., age distribution) by grouping values into bins, showing how data is distributed. Both help identify patterns, trends, and outliers in a dataset.
